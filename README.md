## These may seem confusing but let me explain

### We need data for doing Data Science tasks. And there is so much data in webpages. So web scraping is a very important tool to gather data in case you do not have access to the data of some big organization (precisely my case). So people like me do not feel motivated to go that way because we are not getting data to try out the skills

### So, I have linked a video playlist on YouTube that teaches web scraping and I have also linked the news article from which we are gathering the data

#### This repository is for me to refer to later sometime if I forget the basics. Since the playlist is very well-explained, I am not explaining much in my notebook. As I said earlier, it is just a reference for me

##### If you want to learn too, the links I have attached is very helpful. So check them out
